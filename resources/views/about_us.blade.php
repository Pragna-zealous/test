            <p>We believe that most people want to do good and donate for a cause, but the giving process is often times tedious,
                not very transparent neither super effective. That’s where we come in. At We/Can, our goal is not to try
                and convince you to give, our goal is to help you give by making the process simple, transparent and highly
                effective.
            </p>
            <p>We want to empower the individual philanthropist and create a community of smart, habitual givers contributing
                towards sustainable poverty alleviation. Our goals are sky-high but we feel confident in achieving them because
                we are betting on people’s inherent goodness and in our minds that is a safe bet.</p>
